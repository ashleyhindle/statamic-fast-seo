## What's different from other SEO Addons?
There are already quite a few SEO addons in the Statamic marketplace. Why use ours?    

Firstly, because **you control the entire markup**. We do not want to impose anything. This addon only computes the values and you can place them in any tag you want and can even reuse the values for multiple tags.

Secondly, because every **computation is done using Antlers logic and conditions**. The formula is even customizable from the settings. No need to overwrite any view or config. Everything can be done from the Control Panel.

Finally, because we focus on **simplicity**. We think an SEO addon should be used to handle value that changes depending on the page or context. Everything else like the final value of Schema.org can be generated with free online tools and integrated into your layout once for all.

## Getting Started
